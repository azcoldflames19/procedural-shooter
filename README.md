A retro-styled, procedurally generated top-down shooter written in **Python** using **Pygame**. Battle your way across floating islands rendered in an abyss-purple palette while fending off endless waves of enemies.

## Features
- Procedural terrain generation with purple gradient cliffs hovering above a cyan ocean.
- Wave-based combat featuring ranged weapons, particles, and shockwave effects.
- Smooth camera movement, screen-shake, and radial start-of-game fade-in.
- Fully commented codebase for easy hacking – see top‐of‐file headers.
